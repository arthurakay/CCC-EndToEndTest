This is the Todo MVC app for AngularJS, stolen from the TodoMVC repo and modified to fit the "angular-seed" architecture.

I also added unit tests and a variety of other things (more below).

This will serve as an example project for my "End-to-End Unit Testing for Web Developers" talk at Chicago Code Camp 2013.

=====

NOTES

"angular-seed" - https://github.com/angular/angular-seed

This provides the default application setup, architecture, and testing resources.

I have added some additional scripts in the project root, as well as the /_test/ folder - everything else is the stock angular-seed architecture.

=====

DEPENDENCIES

Currently, the dependencies are:
  - Anything that comes by default from angular-seed (like Testacular... see the README in the angular-seed repo for more info)
  - Node.js
    - LintRoller
    - YSlow
    - Express
  - PhantomJS
